# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Added support for Python 3.12 (#272)

### Changed
- Introduced `pyproject.toml` and moved metadata from `setup.py` (#267)
- Removed use of deprecated `pkg_resources` (#271, #274)

### Fixed
- Fixed an issue with non-ELF "binary" files in PyInstaller archives causing a crash (#270)


## [0.14.1] - 2023-08-07
### Fixed
- Reverted invalid fix ([#255]) for libnssfix link failure ([#262])
- Fixed issue causing libnssfix link failure when building on GLIBC 2.34 again,
  by linking against versioned SONAME (.2) ([#259])


## [0.14.0] - 2023-07-10
*This release was pulled from PyPI due to an incorrect fix in #255.*

### Fixed
- Fixed issue causing libnssfix link failure when building on GLIBC 2.34 ([#255])

### Removed
- Dropped support for Python 3.5 and 3.6 ([#247])


## [0.13.9] - 2023-04-16

- Refuse to process files with PyInstaller 4.1 or 4.2 ([#238])
  - Note: This applies even if the files were built with a different version of
    PyInstaller; if that version is 4.1 or 4.2, the original bug will manifest.


## [0.13.8] - 2022-08-07
### Fixed
- Fixed a problem with 0.13.7 release whl (PyPI won't allow re-uploads)


## [0.13.7] - 2022-08-07
### Fixed
- Fixed an issue where library symlinks with the same basename would present
  problems ([#225])
- Don't crash if .git/ dir is present but git is not installed ([#226])
- Fixed potential issue where bootloader linked against glibc could result in
  target NSS libraries being loaded and causing a cash at startup ([#228])

## [0.13.6] - 2021-12-02
### Changed
- Change `--debug` option to appear in CLI help output

### Fixed
- Fix bug sometimes causing a crash when `-l` is used ([#217])

## [0.13.0] - 2021-10-04
### Added

  added, unless those libraries come from a PyInstalled application. ([#173])

### Changed
- Rework library-adding code to lazily copy libraries before modifying ([#192])


## [0.12.3] - 2021-09-04
### Added

  to discover dependencies ([#185])


## [0.12.2] - 2021-05-22

- Set NODEFLIB flag to prevent any libraries from the target system
  from being loaded ([#138])
- "nssfix" is used to prevent target system `/etc/nssswitch.conf` from being
  used which would attempt to load system `libnss_*.so` libraries ([#139])
